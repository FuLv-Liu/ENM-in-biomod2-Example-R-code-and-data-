Hi, hoping these R code and data can help you conduct the ecological niche modelling (species distribution modelling).

Notice: the environment variables we use to project future and past (LGM) is different. For the LGM, we can only use the temperature and precipitation, because there aren't other variables
in the LGM. For the future, we can use other variables except temperature and precipitation in the current to project to futue (2050, 2090), as 2090 is a short time that many variables
will not change much between current and fure.
